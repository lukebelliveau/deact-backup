# __Deact__
## React under the hood

*__Please note that this project is in its infancy. The slide deck and curriculum are far from completed.__*

#### what
This repository is for those looking to learn how React works under the hood.

The curriculum assumes a familiarity with Javascript, React and git.

#### structure
Lessons are split up into branches. Lesson x.0 contains the answer key - for
example, branch 2.0-static-render-dom contains the answer key for
Lesson 2, static-render-dom.

I am working on making branching checkpoints inside of lessons, so you can follow along by checking out x.1, x.2, etc, but this is incomplete.

#### how
Follow along with [this slide deck](https://docs.google.com/a/thoughtworks.com/presentation/d/1ylwz_h6AxcJDuLLxcrhzVnG_gjdru9byCsRsFmX5uQ4/edit?usp=sharing). You will be prompted when it is time to start a new lesson in the repository.

Lessons are generally in a test-driven fashion: for each lesson, you will have a suite of tests that you must pass. However, some branches are simply examples.

Once all tests are passing in a suite, you will have built a new piece of Deact. Run `yarn devserver` to see the fruits of your labor in a browser.

This is based on React's stack reconciler. This implementation has been overhauled with React Fiber, but the concepts are similar.
